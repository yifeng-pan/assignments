        Since $\sigma(1) = 1$ holds true for the identity,
        $H$ contains the identity.
        $H$ inherits associativity from $S_4$.

        All elements of $H$ has the form 
        \(
            \left [
                \begin{array}{c|ccc}
                    1 &0 &0 &0 \\
                    \hline
                    0 \\
                    0 & & \tau \\
                    0 \\
                \end{array}
            \right ]
        \) 
        for some $\tau \in S_3$.
        when written as permutation matrices.
        Since the transpose of a permutation matrix is its inverse,
        every element of $H$ has an inverse.
        Since the transpose has the same form, 
        the inverse is in $H$.

        The block matrix form of $H$ retains its form after matrix multiplication
        with any two elements of $H$.
        Therefore $H$ is closed.

        % Since $\lall A,B \in H$, $AB$ has the same block matrix form as $A$ and $B$,
        % $AB \in H$.

        Therefore $H$ is a group. Since $H \subseteq S_4$, it is a subgroup of $S_4$.
    
    \subsection{
        \smath{Assuming (2.2), show that 
            $g H g^{-1} = \set{g \circ h \circ g^{-1} | h \in H}$ 
            is a subgroup of $S_4$, for all $g \in S_4$.
        }{(iii)}
    }
        Let $e$ be the identity, which is $\in H$.
        So $e = g g^{-1} = (ge)g^{-1} = geg^{-1} \in gHg^{-1}$.
        $gHg^{-1}$ inherits associativity.
        
        Let $gag^{-1} \in gHg^{-1}$, where $a \in H$.
        We know $\lis a^{-1} \in H$, so $ga^{-1}g^{-1} \in gHg^{-1}$.
        Now, 
        \begin{align*}
            gag^{-1}ga^{-1}g^{-1} 
            &= gaea^{-1}g^{-1} \\
            &= gaa^{-1}g^{-1} \\
            &= geg^{-1} \\
            &= gg^{-1} \\
            = e 
            &= ga^{-1}ag^{-1} \\
            &= ga^{-1}eag^{-1} \\
            = ga^{-1}g^{-1}gag^{-1} 
        \end{align*}
        Therefore every element of $gHg^{-1}$ has an inverse in $gHg^{-1}$.

        Let $gag^{-1}, gbg^{-1} \in gHg^{-1}$, where $a,b \in H$.
        So $gag^{-1}gbg^{-1} = gabg^{-1}$.
        Since $ab \in H$, $gabg^{-1} \in gHg^{-1}$.
        Therefore $gHg^{-1}$ is closed.

        Therefore $gHg^{-1}$ is a group.
        Since $gHg^{-1} \subseteq S_4$, it is a subgroup.
