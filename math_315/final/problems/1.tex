    \subsection[(i)]{Let $C_{15}$ be a cyclic group of order $15$. 
        How many subgroups does $C_{15}$ have? List all of them.
    }
        Let $g$ be a generator of $C_{15}$.

        The order of every subgroup of $C_{15}$ has to divide $15$.

        The divisors of $15$ are $\set{1,3,5,15}$.
        So the subgroups of $C_{15}$ can be generated using $g^1, g^3, g^5, g^{15}$.

        The subgroups are:
        \begin{align*}
                C_{15} &= \set{g^0 = g^{15}, g^1, g^2 , \hdots, g^{14}}, \\
                C_{5} &= \set{g^0 = g^{3^5}, g^{3}, g^{3^2}, g^{3^3}, g^{3^4}}, \\
                C_{3} &= \set{g^0 = g^{5^3}, g^{5}, g^{5^2}}, \\
                C_{1} &= \set{g^0}
        \end{align*}

    \subsection[(ii)]{Give an example of a simple group of order $60$.
        (You do not need to justify your answer for part (ii).)
    }
        % Since every simple group of order $60$ is isomorphic to the alternating group $A_5$,
        % $A_5$ itself must be an simple group.
        $A_5$ is the archetypical simple group,
        where every simple group of order $60$ is isomorphic to $A_5$.
