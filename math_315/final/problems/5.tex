        Show that $Q(x) := 200x^3 - 200x^2 + 200x + 100$ is an irreducible polynomial
        over the field $\Q$ of rational numbers.
    }
        Since $Q(x)$ is of degree $3$,
        if it is reducible, it can be reduced into a polynomial of degree $2$ and 
        a polynomial of degree $1$, or three polynomials of degree $1$.
        Either way, if $Q(x)$ is reducible in $\Q[x]$, it has an factor in $\Q$.

        Suppose $Q(x)$ is reducible in $\Q[x]$.
        So $\lis x =\frac{a}{b} \in \Q$ such that 
        $200x^3 - 200x^2 + 200x + 100 = 0$.
        Furthermore, we can assume $a/b$ is in it's irreducible fraction form.
        (Similarly to the common proof that $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational.)

        Now, we prove $a$ and $b$ are both even, and therefore is a reducible fraction.
        \begin{align*}
            0 &= 200x^3 - 200x^2 + 200x + 100  \\
            &= 2a^3b^{-3} - 2a^2b^{-2} + 2ab^{-1} + 1  \\
            \text{(since $b\neq 0$) }
            &= 2a^3 - 2a^2b + 2ab^2 + b^3  \\
            \to b^3 &= -2a^3 + 2a^2b - 2ab^2 \\
            &= 2(-a^3 + a^2b - ab^2) 
        \end{align*}
        Therefore $2$ is a factor of $b^3$, and therefore $2$ is a factor of $b$.
        Let $b = 2c$.
        Now,
        \begin{align*}
            0&=2a^3 - 2a^2b + 2ab^2 + b^3\\
            &= 2a^3 - 4a^2c + 8ac^2 + 8c^3\\
            \to a^3 &= 2a^2c - 4ac^2 - 4c^3 \\
            &= 2(a^2c - 2ac^2 - 2c^3)
        \end{align*}
        Therefore $2$ is a factor of $a$.

        Since $a$ and $b$ are both even, $a/b$ is reducible (Contradiction), and there exists no such $x$.

        Therefore $Q(x)$ is not reducible in $\Q[x]$.
        \qed

    \subsection[(ii)]{
        Compute the sum of the complex roots of $Q(x)$. Justify your answer.
    }
        We find the roots of $100(2x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x + 1)$.

        All polynomials of degree $\geq 2$ are reducible in $\C[x]$.

        So $2x^3 - 2x^2 + 2x + 1 = 2(x - a)(x-b) ( x-c)$,
        where $a,b,c \in\C$ are the complex roots of $Q(x)$.

        We have 
        \begin{align*}
            -abc &= \frac{1}{2} \\
            ab + bc + bc &= 1 \\
            -c + -b + -a &= 1 
        \end{align*}

        The sum of the roots are therefore $-1$.
        \qed

    \subsection[(iii)]{
        Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial in $\Z[x]$ of degree $5$ such that
        $P(1) = 3$ and $P = (x-1)^5$ modulo $3$. Show that as a polynomial in $\Q[x]$,
        $P(x)$ is irreducible.
    }
        % Let $P(x)$ be a polynomial in $\Z[x]$ of degree $5$.

        % Suppose $P(1) = 3$.
        % Suppose $P(x) = (x-1)^5$ in $\Z/3\Z[x]$.

        % Since $(x-1)^5$ is also of degree $5$, $3$ does not divide the leading coefficient of $P(x)$.

        Suppose $P(x)$ is reducible in $\Q[x]$.

        So $ \lis ab = P(x)$, such that $a, b \in \Z[x]$, and the degree of $a$ and $b$ are both $\geq 1$.\\
        (Multiply the factors in $\Q[x]$ by the lowest common multiple of the coefficients of 
        their denominators to get factors in $\Z[x]$.)

        So $3 = P(1) = a(1)b(1)$.

        Suppose $a(1) = 3, b(1) = 1$. 
        (Proof for vice versa is simular.)

        We have $P = ab = (x-1)^5$ in $\F_3[x]$.

        So $a = (x-1)^x$ and $b = (x-1)^y$ in $\F_3[x]$, with $x+y = 5$.

        But $b(1) =1$ in $\Z[x]$, so $(x-1)$ cannot be a factor of $b$ in $\F_3[x]$.

        So $a = (x-1)^5$.
        But the degree of $b$ is by construction $\geq 1$,
        therefore the degree of $a$ plus the degree of $b \geq 6$.
        Contradiction, since $ab = P$.

        Therefore there exists no such factors $a,b$,
        and $P(x)$ is irreducible in $\Q[x]$.
